# Simple ExpressJS example

## What it is

ExpressJS is a microframework for NodeJS. It is very similiar to Ruby's Sinatra and Python's Flask. Express can help you get a basic HTTP web server running but also make organizing your code and design with templates, manage user sessions, connect to databases and provide authentication. 

While ExpressJS does not do everything, it is great for the small apps that need very basic functionality.
