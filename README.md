## "JavaScript servers? That's crazy."

### A kind of re-birth

NodeJS joins the other popular web languages like Python, Ruby and PHP. It can access file systems, create and connect to servers, serve HTML, JSON and XML and manage user sessions.

NodeJS has the added benefit of JavaScript's asynchronous function execution.

## Install NodeJS

Node is available for lots of different platforms including OSX, get a copy here [http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/).

## NPM - Node Package Manager

NPM is one of the nicest package managers. Using a **package.json** file you can declare an app's dependencies.

NPM is included when you download and install NodeJS. [NPMJS.org](https://npmjs.org/) is the official site for the application.
